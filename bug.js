While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the expo-cli's handling of custom environment variables.  I have a .env file with several environment variables, and some of them were not being properly loaded into my Expo app during the development build process.  Specifically, variables containing special characters like underscores or hyphens were ignored or caused unexpected behavior.  The standard variables without special characters loaded correctly.
